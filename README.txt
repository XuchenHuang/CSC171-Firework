We collaborate to complete the project. We do not collaborate the project with anyone else.

We have three java files in total for this project: Canvas.java, Firework.java, and Display.java. In order to launch the program, user should run the Firework.java

To launch the the program, the user have these three files open and run the Firework.java. Then, a window will pop up. There are three sliders, called speed, angle and time respectively. There are drop down menus to choose one of the five colors (colors for the trajectory line and the firework): Black, Red, Blue, Yellow, and Green, and to choose one of five explosion type: Firework!, Concentric Circles, Lines, Flower, Spiral Ring. After setting values for each of them, you will need to click "launch" to explode the firework. Moreover, there is one more explosion type called "Children" for the extra credit.

After launch, the window will show the trajectory of the firework, which is calculated by the parabola formula using the value of speed, angle, and time. Based on the selection of user, the firework shown will be different. 

If Firework! is selected, word "Firework!" will appear at the endpoint of the trajectory
If Concentric Circles is selected, there will be random number of concentric circles drawing at the endpoint of the trajectory.
If Lines is selected, there will be lines drawing around the endpoint of the trajectory, making a big firework.
If Flower is selected, there will be six circles drawing, composing a flower.	
If Spiral Ring is selected, there will be lines and arc drawing to make a spiral pattern.

If Children is selected, there will be a firework that explored twice. There will be eight lines drawing around the endpoint of trajectory, and eight small firework, (which are the children of the big firework) drawing at the end of the eight lines.(Extra credit)
